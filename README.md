# Installation 
We have tested our project with Python 3.6, and the codes should run well using Python version 3.*. 

We recommend to use Conda to manage the installed libraries. After installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), the following packages are required to install:
* pandas (>=0.25.3)
* numpy  (>=1.17.4)
* seaborn (>=0.10.1)
* plotly (>=4.4.1)
 
We use Visual Studio Code to edit all the documents (e.g. files with .md extension) and codes ( e.g. files with .pynb extension) in the project.



# Project Motivation
For this project, I am interested in using [World Cities Database](https://www.kaggle.com/juanmah/world-cities) to understand the following question:

1. Is population evenly distributed in world cities? 
2. If population is not evenly distributed in world cities, what kind of cities are more attractive for people who live in the cities? 
3. Cities in different countries may show different patterns when it comes to popular distribution. For example, in some countries people may prefer to live a very few cities. Other contries, however, seen their population more evenly distributed among its cities. Then, how uneuqlly distributed people are in different countries?


# File Descriptions 
There is only one notebook to showcase all our foundings, and no additional `.py` python file is needed. 

# Results
The main foundings are summarized in our Medium [post](https://medium.com/@majianglin2003/population-distribution-in-world-cities-f58d378c5905). 

# Licensing
The data set is owned and managed by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), and the rest is free to anyone. You can use and modify the codes without any constrains.
